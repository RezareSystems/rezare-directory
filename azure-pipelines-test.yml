# ASP.NET Core
# Build and test ASP.NET Core projects targeting .NET Core.
# Add steps that run tests, create a NuGet package, deploy, and more:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/dotnet-core

# Syntax Recommendations
# Should displayName text be wrapped in single quotes? Can't seem to find anything that says either way, the examples here:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates?view=azure-devops
# use both unquoted strings and single quotes

#trigger:
#- develop

# Available Microsoft-hosted agents can be found here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops
# pool can be defined at the root level, which applies it to every job: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/stages?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#specify-stages
# or at the job level
pool: Default
